Meet the platypus of coding assistants.

Weird name? Sure. But here's the thing about platypuses: they're nature's impossible mashup. Part mammal, part bird, part reptile. Somehow it all works.

That's Platypus CLI.

I built it because I wanted a coding assistant that doesn't lock me in. One where I can spawn 3 agents side-by-side, each talking to different LLMs, all working on different parts of my codebase. Where my data stays local (SQLite, not someone's cloud). Where I'm not begging permission to run `git status`.

What you get:
• Multi-agent orchestration — spawn teams, not solo acts
• Your choice of brain: OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini
• Works offline (SQLite state, Redis optional)
• Actually smart safety (blocks `rm -rf`, not `ls -la`)

244 tests. CI passing. Ready to break.

`npm install -g platypus-cli`

Or come break it with me: https://github.com/firfircelik/platypus-cli

Open source. No gatekeepers. Just code.

**Why this works:**

- Opens with a hook ("Meet the platypus")
- Explains the metaphor clearly
- States the problem simply
- Lists what IS there (present tense, exciting)
- Ends with energy and invitation
- Short enough to actually read
